## Background Reading and Information ##

1. Early work on the Environmental Data Retrieval API was done by the Met Ocean Domain Working Group, who used the name Weather on the Web (WotW). They have drafted an [Engineering Report](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Weather-on-the-Web-ER) to summarise the experiences and recommendations.

2. The Met Ocean Domain Working Group will produce an OGC Best Practice document to give guidance to implementers of services in a meteorological context. This will be in a new OGC GitHub repository.

3. There are some simple [use cases or scenarios](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-environmental-data-retrieval/tree/master/use-cases). 

4. There is some more background material in the [Weather on the Web repo](https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web). The README.md file is a good place to start. Some of the [challenges](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Weather-on-the-Web-ER/blob/master/7-challenges.adoc) are described.

5. The [minutes](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-environmental-data-retrieval/wiki) of this group should highlight the decisions that have been made.

6. The [background for an API](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/wp/16-019r4/16-019r4.html), rather than protocol, serialisation or data format, describes the OGC approach. See also this [blog entry](https://www.opengeospatial.org/blog/2996). The European Union Joint Research Centre (JRC) has also published a [report on Web APIs](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/7144b6b0-0cf9-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en).

7. The API work across OGC is strongly informed by the W3C Recommmendation: [Data on the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/) and the W3C Candidate Recommendation and Technical Note: [Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/), jointly developed by OGC and W3C.

8. OGC's current [Best Practice for developing APIs](https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-Web-API-Guidelines).

9. The EDR API SWG will follow wherever possible the approach of the first modern API standard from OGC, the "[OGC API - Features](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-features)" also available as a [single document](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html). Please bear in mind that we are not dealing with pre-defined features with identifiers.

10. The EDR API SWG is also obliged by OGC Policy to be compatible with the "[OGC API - Common](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common)" emerging standard wherever possible, and to liaise with the appropriate Standards Working Groups and document incompatible essential differences, for future work.
