== Scope

This Standard identifies resources, captures compliance classes, and specifies requirements which are applicable to OGC Environmental Data Retrieval APIs.

This Standard addresses two fundamental operations: discovery and query.

Discovery operations allow the API to be interrogated to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about a distribution of a resource. This includes the API definition of the server as well as metadata about the spatio-temporal data resources provided by the server.

A spatio-temporal data resource is a **<<collection-definition,collection>>** of spatio-temporal data that can be sampled using OGC-API Environmental Data Retrieval query patterns.

Query operations allow other data resources, such as environmental ones, to be sampled from the underlying spatio-temporal data resource, or data store, based upon EDR query geometry and other selection criteria, defined by this standard and selected by the client.
