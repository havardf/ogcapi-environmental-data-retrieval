== Requirements Class Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

OGC APIs provide Web based capabilities which are typically based on polling for collection resource updates (new features/records items, coverages, maps, etc.). Depending on a collectionâ€™s temporal resolution or frequency of updates, an event-driven / Publish-Subscribe architecture provides a time, efficient and low latency approach for delivery of data updates. The following requirements and recommendations apply to Publish-Subscribe architectural patterns to OGC APIs.

=== Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_pubsub.adoc[]

Event-driven workflows provide publish-subscribe based capabilities as part of information systems and architectures. The publish-subscribe model also provides efficiencies in providing data "as it happens", thereby preventing potential clients from continuous polling to check on the availability of new data/resources.

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has conducted significant work on event-based models and architectures. The publish-subscribe model results in less network traffic and more timely responses to manage event-based models such as urgent, temporally unpredictable data (examples include, but are not limited to: traffic conditions, weather or hazard warnings, and real-time sensor data).

Building on the OGC Publish-Subscribe Interface Standard https://docs.ogc.org/is/13-131r1/13-131r1.html[OGC 13-131r1], as well as the recommendations put forward in the OGC Pub/Sub White Paper [OGC 20-046] produced as part of OGC Testbed 12, as well as the Discussion paper for Publish-Subscribe workflow in OGC APIs [OGC 23-013], the  EDR - Part 2: Publish-Subscribe Standard discusses approaches for integrating publish-subscribe architecture into the OGC API suite of Standards.

=== OGC API Considerations

The OGC API building block approach would typically be used for shared components in API implementations in support of a polling workflow. Using HTTP, this means that the client initiates and invokes requests and receives responses from the server.  A key concept of the OGC API building blocks afchitecture is the endpoint hierarchy, which can be applied for Pub/Sub workflow as follows:

* Data producers: Messages are published to a broker, applied to a given channel (example: ``collections/mycollection``).
* Broker provisioning: Published messages are sent to subscribers.
* Subscribers and data consumers: Messages are received by users subscribed to one or more channels (explicitly or using wildcards/filtering).

The above workflow requires adherence to a hierarchy of channels, auto-discovery of channels, as well as processing of generic messages for broad interoperability by all components.

==== Message payloads

For smaller payload workflow, implementations of OGC API Standards can additionally provide a channel for notification metadata in order to receive a smaller message payload, which a user can process to determine whether to further interact with the reference data granule or resource.

==== AsyncAPI

Based on research and testing, the Pub/Sub White Paper recommended the use of AsyncAPI. AsyncAPI provides an event-driven equivalent of what is provided by OpenAPI for OGC API Standards (description of protocols, channels, parameters, models, etc.). An implementation of the OGC API landing page requirements class can provide a link to an AsyncAPI document as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
    "rel": "service-desc",
    "type": "application/json",
    "title": "AsyncAPI document",
    "href": "https://example.org/asyncapi"
}
----

==== Providing notification metadata as an OGC API endpoint

For Brokers providing notification metadata (as opposed to actual data payloads), an implementation of OGC API Building Blocks can, in parallel, readily provide GeoJSON-based notification messages via an OGC API - Features endpoint. Providing message payloads via an implementation of OGC API Standard(s) provides the additional benefit of querying for past messages over time in case of a lost connection.

==== Providing Pub/Sub links to collection updates

The links array could also provide references to the Pub/Sub capabilities available on the service. A *collection* link could reference a collection update notification channel.

NOTE:  In the OGC API Suite of Standards, a collection is a geospatial resource (such as a dataset) that may be available as one or more sub-resource distributions that conform to one or more OGC API standards.

An *items* link could reference a data payload channel:
