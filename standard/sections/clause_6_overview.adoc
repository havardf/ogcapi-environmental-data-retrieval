== Overview

=== General

The https://ogcapi.ogc.org/[OGC API] standards enable access to resources using the HTTP protocol and its associated operations (GET, PUT, POST, etc.). OGC API-Common defines a set of facilities which are applicable to all OGC APIs. Other OGC standards extend API-Common with facilities specific to a resource type.

This OGC API-EDR standard defines an API with the following goals:

. To make it easier to access a wide range of data through a uniform, well-defined simple Web interface;
. To allow clients to retrieve a subset of data created by the API in response to a standardized, coordinate orientated, query pattern;
. To provide 'building blocks' allowing the construction of more complex applications.

The EDR API can be considered a 'Sampling API'. The query creates a discrete sampling geometry against the spatio-temporal data resource of a relatively persistent data store. The query and its response are transient resources, which could be made persistent for re-use if required.

The functionality provided by EDR query patterns could be realized through specific implementation of the SOS (and to some extent WCS) from the https://www.ogc.org/standards/common[OGC Web Services family of (XML-based) standards]. EDR introduces a streamlined JSON-based OGC API implementation of building blocks that could be used for many of the simple similar use cases addressed by SOS and WCS in the past.

The EDR API defines behavior for the HTTP GET operation. Future versions may introduce additional methods as required, consistent with RFC 7231.

Where:

* `{root}` = Base URI for the API server
* `{collectionId}` = an identifier for a specific <<collection-definition,collection>> of data
* `{instanceId}` = an identifier for a specific version or <<instance-definition,instance>> of a <<collection-definition,collection>> of data
* `{queryType}` = an identifier for a specific query pattern to retrieve data from a specific <<collection-definition,collection>> of data
