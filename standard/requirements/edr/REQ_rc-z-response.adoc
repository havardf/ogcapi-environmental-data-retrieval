==== *Requirement /req/edr/z-response* Parameter z response

[requirement,type="general",id="/req/edr/z-response", label="/req/edr/z-response"]
====

*A:*

If the `z` parameter is provided, only resources that have a vertical geometry that intersects the vertical information in the `z` parameter SHALL be part of the result set.

---
*B:*

The `z` can be defined as a height range by specifying a min-level and max-level seperated by a forward slash "/"

---
*C:*

A list of `z` can be defined be specifying a comma delimited list of values level1, level2, level3 etc

---
*D:*

An Arithmetic sequence using Recurring height intervals can be specified by **R**`number of intervals`**/**`min height`**/**`height interval`

---
*E:*

If the `z` parameter is not provided, the server SHOULD return data at all available vertical levels
